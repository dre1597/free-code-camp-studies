# Tribute Page

Well, the idea of the project was to make a tribute page, the first person that appears in my mind was Kei Goto, vocalist of the band pay money to my pain. I was listening to a song called [Voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62NeCzZmuU) that already is a tribute to him, so I make this project.

I make this project simple, just on the level of the test runner.

I don't think I will grow or improve this project.
